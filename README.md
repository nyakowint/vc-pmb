## vc-pmb
originally dubbed "MiDBridge"

**THIS IS NOT A VENCORD PLUGIN ON ITS OWN**

It is a "bridge" between the PreMid extension and vc-premid plugin.
The plugin can be found [here](https://github.com/nyakowint/vc-premid)

# Usage

Node.js is required (duh)

1. `git clone` this repo
2. `pnpm i` then `tsc` or smth
3. Use start.bat shortcut or `node ./dist/index.js`
- It should connect automatically
  - If not simply reload discord or press "Reconnect PreMid" in Vencord Toolbox (enable it, its good)
4. use premid normally? idk lol

```
git clone https://github.com/nyakowint/vc-pmb
cd vc-pmb
pnpm i
tsc
node ./dist/index.js
```
